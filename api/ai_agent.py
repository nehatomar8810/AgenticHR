    - Carefully analyze each candidate based on how well their scores align with the job role.
    - Consider the balance and relevance of all scores for the job requirements.
    - Do not perform any mathematical calculations like averaging.
    - Make a holistic judgment considering all score dimensions and how they relate to the job.

    Your Response:
    - First analyze and filter out any clearly unsuitable candidates.
    - From the remaining ones, choose up to 2 candidate IDs who are the best fit.
    - Provide the IDs of the selected candidates in the following JSON format:

    ```json
